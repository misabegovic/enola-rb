# enola Prism reference provider.
#
# Parses every **/*.rb under the path given as ARGV[0] with Prism (the Ruby
# parser that ships in the standard library from Ruby 3.3) and emits JSONL
# call facts on stdout in enola's fact schema — one fact per method call,
# typed by what the receiver resolves to LEXICALLY. No runtime, no gems, no
# guessing:
#
#   receiver is a constant                  -> callee "Const#method",     resolution_level "constant-receiver"
#   self or no receiver, inside a def
#   nested in a nameable class/module       -> callee "Enclosing#method", resolution_level "lexical-self"
#   anything else                           -> callee "method",           resolution_level "name-only"
#
# Fact naming is designed to ADD typed call edges without colliding with the
# identities enola's own Ruby extractor emits — the extractor already owns the
# symbol facts, and the seam skips any provider fact sharing a name+kind
# identity with an extractor fact. Every fact here is therefore kind
# "dependency" with the distinctive name "prism-call: <caller> -> <callee>",
# carrying one calls relation targeting the callee. The seam stamps
# provider/provider_version onto accepted facts; this script declares only
# resolution_level, which the seam requires on every provider fact.
#
# Determinism: files are enumerated in sorted order, output lines are sorted
# before printing, and nothing time- or environment-dependent is emitted.
# vendor/, node_modules/ and tmp/ subtrees are skipped at any depth; a file
# Prism cannot parse cleanly is skipped whole — fail closed, never guess.
# --version prints a fixed semver on stdout and exits, which is how the seam
# learns what build it is talking to.
